        "Let's start with a warmup exercise to practice our Python.  We are going to perform some basic analysis of the stock price for a fictional company NewCo.  Let's suppose we receive some data on the last 10 days of NewCo's stock price.  The data is in the form of a dictionary 'newco_dict' where the keys are ['DATE','LOW','HIGH','CLOSE'].  'DATE' contains a list of string dates. 'LOW' and 'HIGH' each contain a list of the lowest price and highest price respectively of the stock during each day in the 10-day period. 'CLOSE' contains a list of the closing price of the stock at the end of each day during the 10-day period.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, newco_dict might look like the following:  \n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "newco_dict = {'DATE':['06-14-21','06-15-21','06-16-21','06-17-21','06-18-21',\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal in this assignment will be to find all the dates during the 10-day period when the closing price of the stock was equal to the mode (most frequent) value of the closing prices over the 10-day period.  We are going to tackle this in two parts.  First we will create a function to find the mode of the closing prices.  In part 2 we will then create a function to identify the dates on which the closing price was equal to the mode.\n",

        "#### Question 1.1\n",
        "Let's first define a function `most_freq_closing(price_dict)` which takes as input a dictionary of prices in the form of 'newco_dict' and returns the most frequent closing price (the mode of the closing prices) during the period as an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways to approach this problem.  One method (although there are others) might be to iterate through the set of the unique closing values and count how often each one appears during the 10 days.  The mode is the one that appears most frequently (has the highest count of appearances).  If there are two closing price values that are equally as frequent in the data, you may return either of them (but only one).\n",
        "\n",
        "How you structure your solution is up to you, although you must complete the `most_freq_closing` function below.  You may include all your solution code within that function or break sub-tasks out into separate smaller functions (which you can insert into the same cell or add a new cell)."
